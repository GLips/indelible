  <h1>How?</h1>

  Indelible doesn&#8217;t let you use the backspace key. That sounds restrictive, and it is. You can&#8217;t detour to rework old sentences. You can&#8217;t write half a thought down and expect to finish it later. Indelible forces focus.<br>
  <br>
  All that exists is what you&#8217;re writing in the moment. As with pen and paper, you start to feel the weight of each word as it drops onto the page. When you sit down and experience it for yourself, it changes the way you approach writing.<br>
  <br>
  Modern text editors like Microsoft Word make it easy to break concentration and jump around to edit. They&#8217;re great for writing finished, polished stories and essays, but not for practicing or first drafts because it lacks the built-in focus of a permanent medium.<br>
  <br>
  When your editor makes each word count, you pay more attention&mdash;and that focus is the key to improvement.<br>
