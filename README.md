**Indelible is an online journal that will make you a better writer.**

It’s just like pen and paper—once you put a word down, it’s there forever. That means no jumping around to make edits or juggling threads of logic. Your writing is focused on one thing only—your current thought. And that focus is the key to improvement. It’s a meditative experience.
